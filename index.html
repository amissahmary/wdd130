            <p>
                My name is Mary Amissah, a young adult currently pursuing her bachelor's degree in computer
                science at Central University in Ghana. I am a Christian and a member of the Church of Jesus
                Christ of Latter Day Saints. I have a deep love for reading, watching movies and listening to
                music during my leisure time. One of my favorite books is *The Hunger Games* by Suzanne Collins.
                As an aspiring web developer, I am also enrolled in a web development course at BYU-Idaho to
                enhance my skills and excited about the opportunities the future holds for me. I am passionate
                about creating digital solutions and hope to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry. I
                believe that technology, when used wisely, can uplift communities and improve lives. In addition
                to programming, I enjoy learning about design principles and user experience. I am committed to
                lifelong learning and growth. With faith, dedication, and resilience, I look forward to building a
                career that reflects both my values and my ambitions.
