        <p>My name is Mary Amissah, a young adult currently pursuing her bachelor's degree in computer science at
            Central
            University in Ghana. I am a Christian and a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I
            have
            a deep love for reading, watching movies and listening to music during my leisure time. One of my favorite
            books
            is <i>The Hunger Games</i> by Suzanne Collins.
            As an aspiring web developer, I am also enrolled in a wedb development course at BYU-Idaho to enhance my
            skills
            and excited about the opportunities the future holds for me.
